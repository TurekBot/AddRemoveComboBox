It's like a ComboBox, but the user can add and remove items directly. T'was my first custom SceneBuilder component on The Maven Central Repository.

### How do I get set up? ###

For the uninitiated:

 * [SceneBuilder](http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) is a WYSIWYG User Interface Designer for JavaFX.
 * You can have SceneBuilder download custom components directly from online repositories like Maven Central.

## Scene Builder ##
* To download *AddRemoveComboBox* to your SceneBuilder installation: 
    * ![JAR/FXML Manager](https://i.imgur.com/OUtwfRd.png)
    * ![Search repositories](https://i.imgur.com/eZwhO7Q.png)
    * ![Get it!](https://i.imgur.com/fqKNUnP.png)

## Your Project ##
* Don't forget to either 
    * Add the [Maven Dependency](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|tech.ugma.customcomponents|AddRemoveComboBox|) to your project's POM, if you're using Maven.
    * Or (for those without Maven experience, like I once was) do it manually
        * [download the JAR](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/tech/ugma/customcomponents/AddRemoveComboBox/)
            * Click the most recent version number and then find and download the jar called `AddRemoveComboBox-{Version Number}.jar `
        * Add the jar to your project's dependencies manually. (Google should be helpful for your specific IDE.)



### Who do I talk to? ###

* Feel free to send me a message. I'd be delighted to hear that you're using (or would like to use) my component!
